# putting some styling notes in here
because whatever

user's own text will be black with blue highlights (so, the default)
but, change the color of their active cell from yellow to... brighter blue?
	div.flex-cell.highlighted.active

then, change other user's input to dark purple font
and change their highlighted cells to lavender
don't worry about tracking their active cell

in their scss: .flex-cell.active background-color: #FFDA00
but .flex-cell.highlighted.active ???
